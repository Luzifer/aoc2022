My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)… At least until I no longer have the motivation to think about solutions…

| Day | Language | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| [1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) | [Go](./day01/main.go) | Quick and dirty, not much stucture, no optimizations. Just read the input from `os.Stdin` and spit out the two solutions. |
| [1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) | [Bash](./day01/bash_solution.sh) | Had some time left for the stream and added this as a kind of troll-approach. Works but probably shouldn't be taken too serious. |
| [2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) | [Go](./day02/main.go) | Possibly "slightly" overengineered but it works and has speaking names… |
| [3](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) | [Go](./day03/main.go) | Again quick and dirty, not much documented but does the trick… |
